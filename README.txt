SaleEvent Coupons

== Description ==
-----------------------
**SaleEvent plugin** creates coupons that have all important meta data for SaleEvent by Schema.org, such as: location, title, start date, end date, description, link. Plugin displays the coupons in three groups: Active coupons, Future coupons and Past coupons. For active ones, plugin displays link and days remaining, for the future ones - days to start. Apart from that, the plugin displays also an archive with pagination for the past coupons if there is more that 8 of them.

== How to use this plugin ==
-----------------------
1. Install the plugin (using admin or FTP).
2. **IMPORTANT!** Before you start adding the coupons, go to the "Sale Events" tab -> "Settings" in your wp-admin and fill in your company info. This step is crucial if you want the plugin to add meta data to your coupons properly.
3. Go to 'Add new', and fill the coupon info. All inputs (title, dates, link, text and thumbnail) are important for the Schema.org meta data.
4. In order to display the coupons (active, future and past) insert a shortcode **[sale-event]** on whatever Wordpress page you want. The shortcode will display all active coupons, all future coupons and 8 past coupons.
5. Create another Wordpress page and insert [coupons-archive] shortcode. Here will be displayed all coupons that are not active anymore, paginated (8 per each page).
